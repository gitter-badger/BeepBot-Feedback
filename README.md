# BeepBot Feedback

This is the public issue tracker for people using the BeepBot on the [Beam.pro](http://beam.pro) streaming website. This is for feedback, suggestions and bug reports. Not for asking to get added to the beta trial runs of the bot. The bot may be open to the public later down the line, but this is not confimed yet.

## Information

When you are making an issue please name the issue appending the start with either `[Bot]` or `[Web]` to make it easier to see which issue is for what.
